its not training because...
it's guessing 0.5 loss for eveythng
- action inputs are vague (multple classes to one acton, how could you learn it)
   - 7 long, 6 is eos token
- my lstm thing literally doesn't work (wouldn't be suprised lol :( ))
   - seems to not just guess 1 thing with random stuff.
- vision is training while everything else is training? and vision make the ins too?
   - freeze vision for 2nd half - nothin...
- batch size too small...
   - nope now it's perfectly pinned to .5 lol
- all the relus are too harsh 
   -  sigmoid?
learning rate was maybe too high?
Seems to be learning with 10x slower lr 

The examples seem to be always in the same order...
So maybe it's not getting a truly random sample of the data?

gen_poss
poss_this_turn
midpoint
acts
num_moves
