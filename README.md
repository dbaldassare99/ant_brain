# ant_brain
* My repo to try out research ideas for small(ish) networks.
* The name comes from how bugs have teeny brains, but are capable of working with turbulence and other systems that we haven't solved.

# why
* It's fun (＾▽＾)
* I know that scaling is king for SOA, and I agree with Hinton. That said, it's not like we've done anywhere near an exaustive search of neural nets, so we should keep on looking for new architectures.
